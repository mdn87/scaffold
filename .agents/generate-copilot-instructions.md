# GitHub Copilot Instructions Generation

When applying scaffold to a project, generate `.github/copilot-instructions.md` if it does not already exist.

## What to Include

Synthesize content from `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` (or equivalent project context files) into a single file in Copilot's native format:

- **Project table** — active directories and what they contain
- **Skip lists** — directories and file types to ignore
- **Operating rules** — always-ask-before guardrails and safe auto-run defaults
- **Per-project quick-reference** — install, run, and architecture summary

## Rules

- Create `.github/` if it does not exist.
- Never overwrite an existing `.github/copilot-instructions.md` without user confirmation.
- Keep the file concise — Copilot reads it on every request; avoid redundant or verbose sections.
- Mirror the same guardrails from `.agents/always-approve-whitelisted-commands.md` and `quota-drain-prevention.md` so all agents share consistent operating boundaries.
